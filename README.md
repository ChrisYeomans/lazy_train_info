# Lazy Train Info

The idea of this project is to make website that displays data similar to the
info boards in train stations, updated a few time a minute with ajax.

I will take in all the info from the link [api link](http://api.irishrail.ie/realtime/realtime.asmx/getStationDataByCodeXML?StationCode=mhide)
then I will display all of the platform boards that the user can also click 
into for more detailed info about the platform and then each individual train.

I will not show train terminating at the selected station

Delayes will be shown with extra emphasis.
